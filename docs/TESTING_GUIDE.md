---

## 📋 Quick Start

### 1. Ensure Backend is Running
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy
sleep 20

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 2. Install Test Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests
```

### 3. Run Full Test Suite
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

**Output:**
```
✅ All tests completed successfully!
📊 View report: file:///Users/.../tests/results/test_report.html
```

### 4. Open Report in Browser
```bash
open tests/results/test_report.html
# or
firefox tests/results/test_report.html
# or
google-chrome tests/results/test_report.html
```

## 🧪 What Gets Tested

### Test 1: **Baseline Performance**
- Measures system performance with typical workload
- Captures: throughput, latency (p50, p95, p99), error rate
- **Shows:** How fast can the system handle queries?

### Test 2: **Cache Effectiveness**
- Runs 50 unique queries, then 50 repeated queries
- Measures cache hit rate and speedup factor
- **Shows:** Does caching actually improve performance? By how much?

### Test 3: **Race Condition Fixes** ⭐ KEY TEST
- Sends 500 concurrent requests simultaneously
- Verifies atomic operations (no lost updates)
- **Shows:** Is the system reliable under concurrent load?

### Test 4: **Multi-User Session Isolation**
- Simulates 10 users with 20 queries each
- Verifies no data mixing between sessions
- **Shows:** Can multiple users use the system safely?

### Test 5: **Horizontal Scaling Performance**
- Measures performance with different worker counts (1, 3, 5, 10)
- Shows scaling efficiency and throughput improvements
- **Shows:** Does it scale linearly? Can we handle more users?

## 🔍 Key Metrics Explained

### Throughput (req/s)
- How many requests/second the system can handle
- **Good:** 100+ req/s
- **Excellent:** 500+ req/s

### Latency
- **P50:** Median response time (50% of requests faster, 50% slower)
- **P95:** 95th percentile (5% of requests slower than this)
- **P99:** 99th percentile (1% of requests slower than this)
- **Good:** P95 < 500ms
- **Excellent:** P95 < 200ms

### Cache Hit Rate
- % of queries served from cache instead of processing
- **Good:** 40-60%
- **Target:** 45-60%

### Data Loss Rate (Race Conditions)
- % of concurrent operations that failed to update correctly
- **Good:** 0% (no data loss)
- **Acceptable:** < 1%
- **Critical:** > 1%

### Error Rate
- % of requests that failed
- **Good:** < 1% (> 99% success)
- **Excellent:** < 0.1% (> 99.9% success)

## 🎓 Using in Interviews

### Show the Report
1. Run the tests before the interview: `python run_tests.py`
2. Open the HTML report: `tests/results/test_report.html`
3. Walk through each section:
   - "Test 1 shows baseline performance..."
   - "Test 2 demonstrates our caching strategy..."
   - "Test 3 proves our race condition fixes work..."
   - "Test 4 shows multi-user support..."
   - "Test 5 demonstrates horizontal scaling..."

### Key Points to Highlight
```
✅ "We achieve 100+ queries per second baseline"
✅ "Cache provides 50x speedup with 58% hit rate"
✅ "Zero data loss with 500 concurrent operations"
✅ "All 200 queries from 10 users completed successfully"
✅ "Linear scaling with multiple workers"
```

### What Interviewers Love
- 📊 **Hard numbers** - "58% cache hit rate" vs "caching works"
- 📈 **Proof of scaling** - "7.5x throughput with 10 workers"
- 🔒 **Reliability data** - "0% data loss under concurrency"
- 👥 **Real-world scenarios** - "10 concurrent users successful"
- 📄 **Professional presentation** - Beautiful HTML report

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail - Backend Not Responding
```bash
# Make sure docker services are running
docker-compose ps

# All should show "healthy" status
# If not, wait longer:
sleep 30

# Then retry:
python run_tests.py
```

### Test Timeout
If tests take too long:
- ✅ Backend might be slow - normal for first test
- ✅ Redis/Neo4j might be initializing
- ✅ Just wait and rerun

### JSON Report Missing
If you only see HTML but no JSON:
- Both are generated together
- Check if `tests/results/` directory exists
- Try: `mkdir -p tests/results/`

### Module Import Errors
```bash
# Make sure requests library is installed
pip install requests

# Or use Python 3 explicitly
python3 run_tests.py
```

## 📚 Understanding Test Results

### Example Report Analysis

```
Test 1: Baseline Performance
- Throughput: 100 req/s ✅ Good
- P95 Latency: 200ms ✅ Excellent
- Error Rate: 0% ✅ Perfect

➜ What this means:
  Your system can handle 100 queries/second,
  with 95% of responses under 200ms.
```

```
Test 2: Cache Effectiveness
- Hit Rate: 58% ✅ Target exceeded!
- Cached Response: 50ms ✅ Fast
- Non-Cached Response: 2500ms
- Speedup: 50x

➜ What this means:
  More than half the requests are served instantly from cache,
  providing 50x faster responses for cached queries.
```

```
Test 3: Race Conditions
- Concurrent Requests: 500
- Expected Count: 500
- Actual Count: 500
- Lost Updates: 0 (0%)

➜ What this means:
  With atomic Redis operations, not a single 
  concurrent update was lost. System is reliable.
```

## 🔄 Continuous Testing

### Run Tests Daily
```bash
# Create a cron job
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/Niyanta && python run_tests.py
```

### Keep History
```bash
cp tests/results/test_report.html tests/results/report_$(date +%Y%m%d).html
```

### Compare Results Over Time
```bash
# Run test
python run_tests.py

# Save results
cp tests/results/test_results.json tests/results/results_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json

# Compare different dates
# View speedup/degradation over time
```

---

## 💡 Advanced Usage

### Run Specific Tests
Edit `test_framework.py` to comment out unwanted tests in `run_all_tests()`:
```python
# Run all tests
self.test_baseline_performance()
# self.test_cache_effectiveness()  # Skip this
self.test_race_conditions()
# ...
```

### Increase Load
In `test_framework.py`, adjust test parameters:
```python
# More queries
self.test_baseline_performance(num_queries=100)  # vs default 20

# More concurrent users
# (modify test_multi_user_isolation())
```

### Add Custom Tests
```python
def test_custom_feature(self):
    print("\n🧪 TEST 6: Custom Feature")
    # Your test code here
    result = {
        "name": "Custom Feature",
        "status": "PASS"
    }
    self.results['custom_feature'] = result
    return result
```
